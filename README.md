# 496ManimProject

Humble 496 project code that makes some Manim videos about various ranked choive voting schemes.

IRV1 and IRV2 are simple videos about IRV that I made to get the basics down. Borda1 is the code
for generating random elections and making a video of them. It probably needs a bit more to work 
with fully random elections and needs some messing about in the code since I made there be less
randomness to make testing easier and rendering in 1080p easier. Though the randomness options are
fairly well doccumented.
